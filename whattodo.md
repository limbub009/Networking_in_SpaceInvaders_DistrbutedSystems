ARTIFICAL NETWORK DELAY
	Thread Sleep
	Delay after pressing a key or in msg transmission in network
	Delay on client or server

Bucket Synchronization
	Server keeps track of the delay between the different clients, and equalises the latency for each client (player).
	Players are synced, no advantage.

Interest Management
	Only showing part of the game world. To the player based upon their location, updating that when they move.
Dead Reckoning
	No input from the player, the ship will continue to move in the last inputted direction.
	Once the player moves again, the ship moves to the correct location.
Smooth Correction
	Instead of jumping to the location, you can see ship move in real time to the location.
Cheating
	Any illegal movement on the client side, eg ability to move faster, or shoot faster, or invisibility bullets.
Cheating Detection
	Whatever cheat we do, we find a detection and countermeasures.
